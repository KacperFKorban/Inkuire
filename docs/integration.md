# Inkuire Integration Guide

### Types of integration

Inkuire provides 3 main ways to integrate with:
- Http server
- JavaScript worker
- Scala library

#### Http integration

Inkuire can be hosted as a http server, providing a REST API for queries.
Most of the code concerning this is located in `engineHttp` module.

REST API:
- "/forSignature" <- takes a parameter `signature` which is a string being the queried Scala signature. e.g. "/forSignature?signature="Int=>Int"".
- "/query" <- html with some example queries and a basic GUI to query the engine.
(see [HttpServer.scala](/engineHttp/src/main/scala/org/virtuslab/inkuire/engine/http/http/HttpServer.scala))



#### JavaScript worker integration

Inkuire can be used as a JavaScript worker. This method is used in the official scaladoc for Scala 3. [link](https://dotty.epfl.ch/api/index.html) [code](https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/tree/master/scaladoc)
Code specific for this integration method is located in `engineJs` module.

JS worker API:
//TODO

#### Scala library

*If you want to use this method, ping us on Twitter, Gitter or Mail, since Inkuire jars aren't published yet*

As any Scala codebase, it can be included as a library dependency.

Then Inkuire can be used in a similar way to [Main](/engineHttp/src/main/scala/org/virtuslab/inkuire/engine/http/Main.scala).

### Data format

In order to work, Inkuire needs to consume one or more "database" files with type information and function signatures.

This output can only be generated by scaladoc at the moment.

In order to generate the correct input for a given library scaladoc (for Scala 3) has to be run with an option `-Ygenerate-inkuire`.
