# Inkuire - Hoogle-like searches for Scala 3 and Kotlin

---

The project was created as the engineering thesis at AGH University of Technology in collaboration with VirtusLab - the 
creators of [dokka](https://github.com/Kotlin/dokka) and [scaladoc](https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/tree/master/scaladoc).

The goal of the project is to provide way of searching extensive functions and methods by given signature for JVM languages.
Currently supported langauges are Kotlin and Scala 3.
